### showtimes_generator
*showtimes_generator.py* is the program that the theatre can run to get a schedule for the day. 

### Usage
To use the generator, the user needs to call `python showtimes_generator.py moviesfile` on the command line. This movie
text file should contain movies showing, each movie on a new line. Each line should contain the movie's name, release year, 
MPAA rating, and runtime. These components should be separated by a comma.
